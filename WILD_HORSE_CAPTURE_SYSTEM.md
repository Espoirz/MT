  - `biome`: Enum for different capture locations
  - `isWild`: Boolean flag for wild-caught horses
  - `captureDate`: Date when horse was captured
  - `overlays`: Array of special visual overlays
  - `temperamentQuality`: Enum for temperament types
  - `bondingPotential`: Numeric bonding score (0-100)
  - `trainingPotential`: Enum for training limitations
  - **Enhanced Stats:** Added `stamina` and `flexibility` stats
  - **New Genetics:** Added `overo`, `pearl`, `brindle`, `chimera` genes

#### User Model (`/server/models/User.js`)
- **New Lasso Inventory:** Added `lassos` object with different lasso types
  - Rope Lasso (starter)
  - Cotton Lasso
  - Nylon Lasso
  - Leather Lasso
  - Wool Lasso
  - Gold Lasso

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### Wild Horse Generation (`/server/utils/wildHorseCapture.js`)
- **Biome System:** 6 different biomes with unique characteristics
  - **Plains:** Default biome, balanced genetics
  - **Beach:** High marking variety, rare patterns, speed/agility focus
  - **Hill Tops:** Clean health genetics, stamina/intelligence boost
  - **Desert:** Rare colors, temperament variation, unique overlays
  - **Snowfield:** Thick-coated breeds, calm temperaments, rare recessives
  - **Volcanic Ridge:** Event-only biome with exclusive coats and extreme stats

- **Maturity Stages:** 3 life stages with different characteristics
  - **Foal (4-12 months):** Limited training, high bonding potential
  - **Yearling (13-24 months):** Moderate training, balanced bonding
  - **Adult (25+ months):** Full training, stubborn temperament

- **Advanced Genetics System:**
  - Biome-specific genetic modifiers
  - Rare pattern generation (Sabino, Splash, Overo)
  - Unique color combinations (Cream, Pearl, Champagne, Brindle, Chimera)
  - Health gene cleanup for Hill Tops biome

#### API Endpoints (`/server/controllers/horseController.js`)
- `GET /api/horses/capture/biomes` - Get available biomes and maturity stages
- `POST /api/horses/capture` - Capture a wild horse

#### Route Integration (`/server/routes/horses.js`)
- Added capture routes to existing horse routing system

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### Wild Horse Capture UI (`/client/src/pages/WildHorseCapture.js`)
- **Biome Selection:** Interactive cards showing:
  - Biome name and description
  - Special effects and bonuses
  - Cost requirements (coins/lassos)
  - Availability status

- **Maturity Selection:** Choose between foal, yearling, or adult
- **Payment System:** Multiple payment options:
  - Coins (always available)
  - Lasso types (biome-specific)
  - Gems (for special biomes)

- **Capture Results:** Detailed results showing:
  - Horse stats and characteristics
  - Experience gained
  - Level up notifications
  - Rarity and special traits

#### Navigation Integration (`/client/src/pages/Horses.js`)
- Added "Capture Wild Horse" button to main horses page

#### Routing (`/client/src/App.js`)
- Added `/horses/capture` route for the capture interface

### 4. Game Mechanics

#### Cost System
- **Plains:** 1 Rope Lasso OR 1,500 Coins
- **Beach:** 1 Cotton Lasso OR 3,000 Coins
- **Hill Tops:** 1 Nylon Lasso OR 4,000 Coins
- **Desert:** 1 Leather Lasso OR 6,000 Coins
- **Snowfield:** 1 Wool Lasso OR 5,000 Coins
- **Volcanic Ridge:** 1 Gold Lasso OR 1 Gem (event-only)

#### Experience System
- Base experience: 50 XP per capture
- Volcanic Ridge bonus: +100 XP (150 total)
- Level progression: 1,000 XP per level

#### Rarity Modifiers
- Each biome has different rarity chances
- Volcanic Ridge has highest rarity modifier (2.0x)
- Beach and Desert have enhanced rarity (1.2x - 1.5x)

### 5. Special Features

#### Biome-Specific Effects
- **Beach:** 2-4 visual markings, rare pattern genes
- **Hill Tops:** 25% cleaner health genetics, stat boosts
- **Desert:** Unique overlays, high temperament variation
- **Snowfield:** Calm temperaments, rare recessive traits
- **Volcanic Ridge:** Exclusive coats, extreme stat variations

#### Event System
- Volcanic Ridge appears only during "Eruption Watch" events
- Framework for bi-monthly special events

#### Visual Enhancement
- Unique overlays for different biomes
- Special color combinations not available in stores
- Breed preferences based on biome characteristics

## Technical Architecture

### Database Integration
- Seamless integration with existing MongoDB schemas
- Backward compatibility with existing horses
- Efficient querying for biome and maturity data

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints following existing patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation and sanitization

### Frontend Architecture
- React components with styled-components
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Real-time balance updates
- Loading states and error handling

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Seasonal Events:** Rotating special biomes
2. **Breeding Integration:** Wild horse genetics in breeding
3. **Training Specialization:** Biome-specific training bonuses
4. **Horse Aging:** Dynamic aging system for foals
5. **Expedition System:** Multi-stage capture adventures
6. **Rarity Trading:** Market for rare wild horses

### Technical Improvements
1. **Caching:** Biome data caching for performance
2. **Analytics:** Capture success rate tracking
3. **Push Notifications:** Event biome alerts
4. **Offline Support:** Capture queue for offline play

## Installation and Setup

1. **Backend:** All changes are in existing files, no additional setup required
2. **Frontend:** UI components are integrated into existing routing
3. **Database:** Schema changes are backward compatible
4. **Dependencies:** Uses existing project dependencies

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Biome selection displays correctly
- [ ] Maturity stage selection works
- [ ] Payment validation functions
- [ ] Capture generates appropriate horses
- [ ] Experience and leveling work
