# Admin System Documentation

## Overview

The MT Breeding Game now includes a comprehensive admin system that allows administrators to manage users, animals, and monitor system statistics.

## Admin Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control

The system now supports user roles:
- **user** (default): Regular users with standard game access
- **admin**: Full administrative access

### 2. Admin Dashboard

Access the admin dashboard at `/admin` (only visible to admin users).

**Dashboard Statistics:**
- Total users count
- Premium vs Basic membership breakdown
- Admin users count
- Total animals (dogs and horses)
- Dogs in shelter
- Wild vs owned animals

### 3. User Management

- Adjust user resources
- User account deletion

### 4. Animal Management

**Features:**
- View all dogs and horses
- Search animals by name or breed
- Filter by animal type
- Move dogs to shelter system
- View ownership information

**Available Actions:**
- Move owned dogs to shelter
- Monitor animal statistics
- Track breeding activities

### 5. Security Features

**Admin Middleware:**
- JWT token validation
- Role-based authorization
- Protected admin routes
- Session management

**Access Control:**
- Admin routes require both valid authentication AND admin role
- Prevents regular users from accessing admin functions
- Protects against admin privilege escalation

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

**Models:**
- `User` model enhanced with `role` field
- Supports 'user' and 'admin' roles
- Default role is 'user'

**Middleware:**
- `adminAuth.js`: Validates admin access
- Checks JWT token AND admin role
- Returns 403 for non-admin users

**Controllers:**
- `adminController.js`: All admin functionality
- Dashboard statistics
- User management operations
- Animal management operations

**Routes:**
- `/api/admin/*`: All admin endpoints
- Protected by adminAuth middleware
- RESTful API design

### Frontend Components

**AdminDashboard Component:**
- Tabbed interface (Dashboard, Users, Animals)
- Real-time statistics display
- User management interface
- Animal management interface
- Search and filter capabilities

**Navigation:**
- Admin link appears in navbar for admin users only
- Shield icon (üõ°Ô∏è) for admin access
- Conditional rendering based on user role

## API Endpoints

### Admin Authentication
- All admin endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Token must belong to user with `role: 'admin'`

### Dashboard
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard` - Get system statistics

### User Management
- `GET /api/admin/users` - Get all users (with pagination/search)
- `PUT /api/admin/users/:id` - Update user (role, membership, coins, gems)
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` - Delete user
- `POST /api/admin/create-admin` - Create new admin user

### Animal Management
- `GET /api/admin/animals` - Get all animals (with pagination/search)
- `POST /api/admin/dogs/:id/shelter` - Move dog to shelter

## Usage Examples

### Creating Additional Admin Users

```bash
# Using the API endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/create-admin \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "admin2",
    "email": "admin2@mtgame.com",
    "password": "newpassword123"
  }'
```

### Updating User Membership

```bash
# Toggle user to premium
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/admin/users/USER_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "membershipTier": "premium"
  }'
```

### Getting System Statistics

```bash
# Get dashboard stats
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/dashboard \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Change Default Password:** Always change the default admin password
2. **Secure JWT Secret:** Use a strong JWT secret in production
3. **HTTPS Only:** Use HTTPS in production environments
4. **Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing rate limiting for admin endpoints
5. **Audit Logging:** Consider adding audit logs for admin actions
6. **Backup Database:** Regular backups of user and animal data

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Admin action audit logs
- Advanced user analytics
- Bulk user operations
- Animal breeding oversight
- Economic system monitoring
- Report generation
- Email notifications for admin actions

### Monitoring & Analytics
- User growth tracking
- Feature usage statistics
- Revenue analytics (premium memberships)
- System performance monitoring
- Security incident tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cannot Access Admin Panel:**
- Verify user has `role: 'admin'` in database
- Check JWT token validity
- Confirm admin routes are properly configured

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check database connection string
- Verify environment variables

**Authentication Failures:**
- Check JWT secret configuration
- Verify token format and expiration
- Ensure admin middleware is properly applied

### Database Queries

```javascript
// Check user role in MongoDB
db.users.find({ role: 'admin' })

// Update user to admin
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: 'user@example.com' },
  { $set: { role: 'admin' } }
)

// Get system statistics
db.users.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: '$role', count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])
```

## Conclusion

The admin system provides comprehensive management capabilities for the MT Breeding Game. It enables efficient user management, system monitoring, and administrative control while maintaining security and ease of use.
